# Netflix Clone - MERN Stack

This project showcases a Netflix clone built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It features a modern, responsive interface that mirrors Netflix's design, allowing users to explore and stream movies and TV shows. It uses The MovieDB API to search for movies and display details. The application includes a robust backend that handles user authentication and data management, while the frontend offers a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Features:
- **Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **Content Navigation**: Browse and search for movies and shows.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
- **Streaming**: Stream content directly within the application.
